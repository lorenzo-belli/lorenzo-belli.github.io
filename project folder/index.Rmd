Welcome to my personal website!

I am Lorenzo Belli, a PhD student in the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF).

I hold a bachelor’s degree in Sociology from Università di Bologna (UNIBO), a master’s degree in Sociology and Social Research from Università di Trento (UNITN) with honours, and a master’s degree in Sociology and Demography from UPF.

I am currently working on the project “Life-course trajectories of abusers and victims of intimate partner violence” lead by Prof. Jorge Rodríguez Menés, and funded by the Agencia Estatal de Investigación.

My main academic interests include social and gender inequalities, gender violence.
