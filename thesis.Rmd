My doctoral thesis is part of the project *“Life-course trajectories of abusers and victims of intimate partner violence”*, funded by the Agencia Estatal de Investigación and cofunded by the European Union. The project hold a comprehensive dataset of perpetrators and victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) in Catalonia (Spain).

Below is the abstract of my paper, currently in progress:

### Victimization trajectories of Intimate Partner Violence

Research has shown that the risk of experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) fluctuates with age, yet relatively few studies have sought to identify latent IPV trajectories across women’s life courses and to examine the sociodemographic and criminological characteristics associated with those trajectories. Using a unique longitudinal cohort of nearly 4,000 women who obtained protection orders against one of the 7,000 men convicted of IPV in Catalonia (Spain) between 2010 and 2015, we employ group‑based trajectory modeling to map women’s experiences of IPV from adolescence into mid-life. We identify two salient trajectories. The first, which we term “moderate‑decreasing”, emerges in the mid‑twenties, peaks modestly, and then declines steadily. The second, labeled “violent‑increasing”, begins and intensifies in the thirties and exhibits a sharper escalation in violent episodes over time. The violent trajectory exhibits markedly higher counts of victimization than the moderate one, showing disproportionately greater incidence across all forms of abuse; i.e., physical, psychological, and unspecified. These divergent life‑course patterns underscore the necessity of age- and context-sensitive prevention and intervention strategies. Particularly for older women whose risk of escalating violence has been underrecognized both in academica and existing policy frameworks.
